# Competition codes
This is where I store the answers to a few programming competition problems. I did not take part in these competitions, I simply decided to try and solve these problems. The algorithms in this repository use a few techniques such as Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and Backtracking.
*Some of the codes in this repository might be written in portuguese.
